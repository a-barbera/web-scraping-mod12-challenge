# web-scraping-mod12-challenge
Personal repository for Module 12 homework challenge for A. Barbera, Data Analytics &amp; Visualization

This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks:
1. Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
2. Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

In order to evaluate the export of the Mars News data into a MongoDB database, the user will need personal access to a MongoDB on their own device and may need to adjust the connection information accordingly.
